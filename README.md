Vueply is a full functional JavaScript / Vue playground in the browser. Everything is simply stored on the server and really easy to use. It is a minimal IDE for easy prototyping in the web.

## 💥 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 🔨 Prerequisites

First things first, you need to clone or fork the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daycademy/vueply/
```

After that go into the cloned directory and type install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
OR
yarn
```

That's it! You are ready to go!

You can run the development server by using:

```sh
npm run serve
OR
yarn serve
```

## 🧪 Running the tests

You can run all tests by executing:

```sh
npm run test:unit
OR
yarn test:unit
```

Make sure that basic tests are in `./test` directory and modules tests are in their corresponding `./modules/**/Tests` directory.

**NOTICE: Tests are not finished yet. Help for tests, is wanted!**

### Coding style tests

You can run the coding style tests by executing the command:

```sh
npm run lint
OR
yarn lint
```

If you make a pull request, make sure you lint your files correctly.

You can force the linter to lint for you by executing:

```sh
npm run lint --fix
OR
yarn lint --fix
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This is a front-end only project **yet**. So you can easily run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
OR
yarn build
```

you can deploy the project to a valid html site. After that, you can simply put these files in the directory in your serve of your choice.

Have fun using it and keep an eye on updates. ;)
